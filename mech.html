  	<th width=1000>The following mechanical drawing shows the setup of our egg shaker mechanical robot. The motor sits upright secured onto the table. We attached an arm that rotates around a z-axis pointing out of the table. In order to get the robot to play the shaker, we alternate the arm of the robot from position one (0 degrees) to position two (90 degrees). Each time it moves from position one to position two or vice versa, it creates a beat. Our code in ‘motor.ino’ can either have the robot play a preset song (the George Lopez theme song) or play eighth notes continuously like a metronome.</th>
